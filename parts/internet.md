Internet - The Internet is a global network of computers connected to each other which communicate through a standardized set of protocols.

`DNS` - The Domain Name System (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet. Humans access information online through domain names, like nytimes.com or espn.com.
Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources.

`Domain Name` - A domain name is a unique, easy-to-remember address used to access websites, such as ‘google.com’, and ‘facebook.com’. Users can connect to websites using domain names thanks to the DNS system. A domain name is a string of text that maps to a numeric IP address

A uniform resource locator (URL), sometimes called a web address, contains the domain name of a site as well as other information, including the transfer protocol and the path. For example, in the URL ‘https://cloudflare.com/learning/’, ‘cloudflare.com’ is the domain name, while ‘https’ is the protocol and ‘/learning/’ is the path to a specific page on the website.

`Hoisting` - Web hosting is an online service that allows you to publish your website files onto the internet. So, anyone who has access to the internet has access to your website.

`HTTP` is the TCP/IP based application layer communication protocol which standardizes how the client and server communicate with each other.
It defines how the content is requested and transmitted across the internet.

An HTTP request is the way internet communications platforms such as web browsers ask for the information they need to load a website.
Each HTTP request made across the Internet carries with it a series of encoded data that carries different types of information.
A typical HTTP request contains:
HTTP version type, a URL, an HTTP method, HTTP request headers, Optional HTTP body.

### World Wide Web (Web, W3) 
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/World_Wide_Web  

`the Web` -  is an interconnected system of public webpages accessible through the Internet. 

Browsers and how they work?

A `web browser` is a software application that enables a user to access and display web pages or other online content through its graphical user interface.  
A Web browser or browser is a program that retrieves and displays pages from the Web, and lets users access further pages through hyperlinks. A browser is the most familiar type of user agent.

`Веб-страница` — документ или информационный ресурс Всемирной паутины, доступ к которому осуществляется с помощью веб-браузера.

`URL`
https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/URL A URL (Uniform Resource Locator)
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/URL is a unique identifier used to locate a resource on the Internet. It is also referred to as a web address.
URLs consist of multiple parts -- including a protocol and domain name -- that tell a web browser how and where to retrieve a resource.

A host (also known as "network host") is a computer or other device that communicates with other hosts on a network.

`URI`
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/URI

`HTTPS` is a secure way to send data between a web server and a browser.

`CORS` Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any origins
(domain, scheme, or port) other than its own from which a browser should permit loading resources.

Content Security Policy
Content Security Policy is a computer security standard introduced to prevent cross-site scripting, clickjacking and
other code injection attacks resulting from execution of malicious content in the trusted web page context. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP

OWASP Security Risks
OWASP or Open Web Application Security Project is an online community that produces freely-available articles,
methodologies, documentation, tools, and technologies in the field of web application security.

### API  
 
An `API` (Application Programming Interface) is a set of features and rules that exist inside a software  
program (the application) enabling interaction with it through software - as opposed to a human user interface.  

In Web development, an API is generally a set of code features (e.g. methods, properties, events, and URLs) that  
a developer can use in their apps for interacting with components of a user's web browser, or other software/hardware  
on the user's computer, or third party websites and services.

### User agent  
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/User_agent

A `user agent` is a computer program representing a person, for example, a browser in a Web context.  
Besides a browser, a user agent could be a bot scraping webpages, a download manager, or another app accessing the Web.


### Hyperlink  
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Hyperlink

`Hyperlinks` connect webpages or data items to one another.  
In HTML, <a> elements define hyperlinks from a spot on a webpage (like a text string or image)  
to another spot on some other webpage (or even on the same page).
